            <p>Growing up in Texas, I always thought my dream was to travel the world working as a freelance
                photographer. It seemed set in stone upon receiving B.A. in fine arts. My itch for adventure took me
                around the world to New Zealand, where I lived in a van and worked as a travel photographer, then to
                South America, and across Asia where I landed in South Korea and eventually began my career as an
                English teacher. I fell in love with education and threw myself into my work, but after a few years, I
                felt like something was missing. I craved a new challenge and room for growth that a new career path
                could bring.</p>

            <p>In 2022, I began my journey at Oregon State University as a CS Postbacc student. My courses have pushed
                me to grow, ignited my love for problem solving and critical thinking, and fulfilled me in a way I've
                never experienced in my professional career. As I progress through my degree and focus my attention
                towards my new career, I look forward to the opportunity to be challenged, learn, and grow daily in a
                field that excites me.</p>

            <p>When I'm not working or coding, I can be found caf√© hopping or continuing my search for the best pork
                belly barbecue in Seoul, South Korea, where I am currently based. As a big foodie, I also love fitness
                and lifting weights and hit the gym every day so that I can have that extra pint on the weekend. I love
                street photography and capturing beautiful images of the world around me and I still get out and shoot
                regularly. Other hobbies include cooking and brewing rice wine.</p>
